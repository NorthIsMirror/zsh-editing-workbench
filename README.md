## Installation With Zgen

Add `zgen load psprint/zsh-editing-workbench` to `.zshrc` and issue a `zgen reset` (this assumes that there is a proper `zgen save` construct in `.zshrc`).
The config files will be available in `~/.config/zew`.

## Installation With Antigen
Add `antigen bundle psprint/zsh-editing-workbench` to `.zshrc`. There also
should be `antigen apply`. The config files will be in `~/.config/znt`.
